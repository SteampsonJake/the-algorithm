Channel nine news cuts to footage taken in front of Nitter headquarters, where a black-and-white husky
in a black pinstripe suit has just exited the building. The words “Musk-Nitter acquisition report: three
months later” stretch across the white banner at the bottom of the screen. As the camera zooms in on the
canine, a female’s voice begins narrating:
“Elon, a musky, multi-billionaire husky, made headlines yet again by purchasing the social media giant
Nitter. The eccentric canine captured the public’s attention last year with his self-made documentary of a
furry’s daily life, including an unflinching look at the hate he received early in his entrepreneurial career.
As one of the first furry figures to welcome media and the limelight, Elon serves as window into an
otherwise secluded community.
“Outrage from anti-furry groups over Elon’s supposed “anthro agenda” threatened to plummet Nitter
stocks soon after the purchase was made public, but as Elon’s relative silence has stretched on, outcry has
died down. While it seems Nitter’s new owner isn’t rocking the boat as hard as anyone thought, many still
wonder what Mr. Musk has planned.”
The footage cuts to later in the press conference. “I don’t feel any pressure to make big, dramatic
changes,” Elon says, looking very professional. “I believe I have a very good idea of what it is people
want, and I intend to give them more of that, even if they don’t realize it.”
The recording volume fades again as the female narrator continues. “Many have wondered about the
meaning of that line from a recent Nitter press conference. As insider reports affirm that Musk has spent
extensive time with the Nitter dev team, many – including channel nine’s business analyst Mark Winters –
assert that Elon was simply referring to data science’s potential for content recommendations.”
The camera cuts to a well-dressed man in an office. “Mark Winters, Channel 9 business analyst” appears
on a temporary banner. “It makes sense,” Mark admits. “Companies like Nitter have access to more data
than ever before.” The footage cuts again. “Some have criticized Elon for replacing several members of
the dev team with… furrier… programmers, but ethical issues aside, if all that time and attention he’s
putting into the dev team means he thinks it’s important – and I believe it does – then I’d say that’s a
good sign for Nitter.”
The news report continues on, examining Nitter’s stock portfolio before showing some street interviews
of typical Nitter users.
CONTEXT
I tried posting some images to the Male Transformation discord I’m on, but for some reason, the image
previews weren’t showing.
Person A: “I think "Nitter" is having some issues.”
Person B: “Musky Elon (sorry) has been breaking the Twitter API a lot”
Person A: “Please never call him that again. I think part of me died reading that. I do not want to
imagine a mus-Gags hard.”
We joked about various nicknames for Elon.
The next day, I added, “Though to be honest, I find the mental image of a social media network being
taken over by a (literal) musky husky to be quite pleasing.” This story continues my comment.
STORY
I would think he'd have his dev team redesign the site and algorithms to subliminally push all users in a
few different directions {gay rights, accepting kinky behaviors as normal and even exploring them
themselves, general social acceptance of furries}. He'd also help users realize they might be gay or
otherwise benefit from a faceful of canine crotch, similar to how TikTok accidentally clued people in
about their undiagnosed ADHD.
Though, of course, he could only start implementing these changes after getting the dev team on board.
Fortunately, this is easy enough, as he has access to them in person. A few months of working around the
lingering smell of horny dog ought to do it, especially when it starts compounding from multiple sources
after about a week. (It goes relatively quickly because about half of the dev team members are gay furries
already.)
I can just imagine their meetings -- the office space is trendy, open, very anti-traditional office culture.
The building is kept to a cozy seventy-something, perfect conditions to cuddle up with a coding partner
and watch the snow fall. The meeting room is dominated by the table in the middle, surrounded by a few
soft chairs, a couch, an exercise ball, and even a beanbag chair. One long wall is all floor-to-ceiling
windows with a commanding view of the city below, but the dark fabric shades have been pulled down to
block the dim light of the winter afternoon sun from shining directly into the room. On the opposite
wall are some hooks and a few empty hangers by the couch, a wall clock above and beside, and a door on
either end. A whiteboard hangs at the front of the room, empty and ignored for now. The small fake
fireplace someone brought in lies dormant in the back, the modest space warmed enough by its seven
occupants. A hunky doberman rests his head on the chest of an equally muscular pit bull on the couch,
making quiet conversation. A femboy twink chihuahua is curled up in the lap of the saint bernard bear
sitting in the beanbag. A well-toned chocolate lab massages the footpaws of the golden retriever sitting in
the chair across from him as they review some of the agenda items with an attentive bichon frise. The tip
of the cock or even a casual half-erection is often visible when the dog's sheath isn't stuffed into a
jockstrap, though even that might not hide everything, as is the case with the doberman's soft tent. With
so many dogs in one space, the otherwise subtle smell of virility and old cum now iconic to the dev team’s
working quarters has begun to dominate the room, adding to the cozy atmosphere of their combined
warmth.
The chihuahua extends his arms out in a lethargic stretch, tongue curling out in a yawn. As he nestles
himself against the saint bernard once more, using the bigger dog's stomach as a cushion, the bernard
scratches behind the little dog's ears affectionately. The three sitting dogs’ conversation shifts to afterwork plans, and some (very) friendly innuendos are exchanged. The room exhales in a collective sigh,
grateful for the reprieve granted by their usually timely leader's tardiness. [“Co-workers with benefits,”
haha.]
The chocolate lab’s ears twitch. “He’s coming,” he notes, cutting off their conversation. Around the
room, the dogs reluctantly sit up, shaking their heads or shifting around in their seats. The chihuahua
hops out of the bernard’s lap and trots over to a chair, though it takes him two tries to hoist himself up
on the padded seat, it being sized for a normal human.
The door near the front swings open to admit a black-and-white husky in a well-made suit. He stops a
few steps into the room, scanning across the seven other dogs with attentive, ice-blue eyes. “Hello,
everyone,” he says in an upbeat tone, shedding his black pinstripe suit coat, “good to see you all today.”
“Morning Elon,” the chihuahua is quick to reply. With equal speed, the doberman moves to the front of
the room to collect Elon’s coat. As the room says the rest of their greetings, a shorter brown poodle slips
in behind Elon, giving the bichon a quick smile and taking the empty seat next to him.
“Sorry about the delay,” Elon apologizes, “but the press interview went a little longer than expected.”
Certain he was among familiar company, the husky doesn’t stop disrobing with his blazer, instead
stripping down to nothing but a well-worn jockstrap. After a moment’s hesitation, that too comes off.
He hands each garment to the doberman, who slips away to the back, arranging them neatly on a few
hangers. “Thank you, that’s much better,” Elon says gratefully, standing bare at the front of the room.
Out of the corner of his eye, he notices his jockstrap is absent from the hooks. Eh, best not to make a
big show of it. His missing underwear tends to reappear on his desk after a few weeks, anyway. He was
pretty sure that some of the jocks that had been “returned” to him weren’t actually his – that, or they had
seen some extensive use while they were gone – but he really didn’t mind. He watches discretely as the
doberman pretends to wipe his nose, but his paw lingers in front of his nose for far too long, and his
whole body shudders in ecstasy. The husky smiles to himself, tail wagging slightly. No, he really didn’t
mind.
“Another interview?” the pit bull jests in a gruff voice after everyone is settled. “That’s the third one this
week! It’s a wonder you have time for anything else.”
The golden retriever peers down at nothing, thinking. “Why so many?” he asks no one in particular.
“It’s been months since you bought Nitter, and nothing notable has happened.”
Elon opens his mouth to answer, but the brown poodle beats him to it. “It’s because of channel nine,” he
says. “They did a follow-up on the buyout, focusing on Elon’s plans for the company. Now everyone
wants to get the scoop on ‘Musk’s secret plans.’ Not that he has anything to hide, beyond getting a little
too intimate with some of his employees, that is. What Elon is planning is perfectly legal, and it would
generally be considered ethical. He’s likely hiding it only because radical anti-furry groups would have a
field day villainous him if they found out. Oh, sorry sir,” he adds when he notices Elon looking at him
askew.
“No, no, you’re good,” Elon assures the poodle. “I just forget how sharp your intuition can be sometimes.
I’m glad I made you my personal assistant.” The poodle blushes. “I’m curious,” Musk continues. “I
haven’t discussed it with anyone. What exactly do you think I’m planning?”
The dog leans back in his chair. “Well, sir, if I had to guess… I would say you want to do something to
change the public opinion on furries.” A few of the other dogs blink hard at that – where was this
coming from? – but the poodle doesn’t seem to notice. “You don’t seem like the type of billionaire who
would buy a company the size of Nitter just for kicks and giggles. You’re too much of a planning type of
person for that. You’ve also focused heavily on advocating for furry rights in your own way in the past,
prioritizing it perhaps above even making money.”
The poodle stands up and begins pacing as he continues. “I wouldn’t think you just spend time with us
for the companionship, either. I’d like to think you would, sir, but I flatter myself. You’re too purposedriven to not have a motive behind getting to know us so well. So whatever you’re planning, sir, it
probably requires a loyal dev team, one that would be willing to support your ambitions no matter what.”
The poodle appears to realize he had paced his way halfway to Elon. He colors visibly and scuttles back
to his chair.
The other dogs shift in their seats a little uncomfortably, turning what the poodle said over and over in
their heads. All Elon ever seemed to want with the dev team (beyond his general managerial duties over
them) was to vent about work. After his influence made them more canine, sometimes he would come by
for cuddles or even the occasional hookup, but that was it. And yet, it sounded all too well like a plan he
might make…
The quiet tap-tap-tap of Elon’s whiteboard marker on the board brings their attention back up front.
Wordlessly, they watch him write in his usual blocky script. “HOW TO MAKE THE PUBLIC BE
OKAY WITH US GAY, KINKY FURRIES,” the board reads.
The pit bull hard stifles a laugh. When Elon raised an eyebrow, the senior programmer raises his paws in
an abating gesture. “Ah, sorry,” he mumbles in his characteristic, happy-go-lucky tone, “it’s just that
Shane had you nailed to a T.” The already meek poodle withdraws farther into his chair, as though trying
to disappear. [Aaaaaay lmao, don’t give anyone names until as late as possible into the story.]
Elon just smiles. “It helps to keep someone cleverer than you close by,” he said wryly. “It keeps you
humble.”
*****
The golden retriever sits back, fascinated. It was clear from the rest of the meeting that Elon had thought
long and hard about his plan, but it was the way everyone else contributed so meaningfully to the
discussion that had him in awe. He hadn’t realized how much he cared about this until he put himself in
the shoes of those he could help. Now, he is in charge of teaching the algorithm how to spot users with
repressed or unrealized homosexual feelings. This was just supposed to be a short-term office job, just
something to pad out his resume so he could jump to a better position later, but for the first time ever,
the retriever found himself getting excited about his work. He shakes his head again, trying to not get
lost in thought.
A knock on his cubicle wall rouses the retriever. “Hey man,” his chocolate lab programming partner says,
“I’m going on my lunch break now. Do you want to join me?”
“Oh, hey,” the retriever replies. He doesn’t say anything more for a moment, tracing up and down the
lab’s toned body. “Ummm… yeah,” he responds elegantly when he’s finally able to get his mouth to
work, shamelessly letting his erection work its way out of his sheath. “I think I’m a little hungry…”
The chocolate lab smirks, though it’s without any malice. “Cutie. I’ll be in the lunchroom.” He turns as
if to go, but before he walks away, he looks back. “You know, that was a great photo. Still is,” he says,
looking at the collage of pictures on the far wall of the cubicle. “If you have some time, maybe we can
try to recreate it after work today.” With that, he walks away.
The retriever follows the lab’s gaze to the collage. It was a display of mostly photos from when they were
all still humans. Which picture did he…? His eyebrows shoot up. Thumbtacked over his collage is a
new photo of the retriever with his nose tucked into the lab’s crotch, forcing the rise in his underwear
higher with his snout. The retriever’s own tent is clearly visible in the corner of the photo. It had been
the first time the retriever fucked with another guy, and though he had had no idea what he was doing, he
still remembers it fondly. They’d both seen a lot of action in the month since, however, and the retriever
thought the lab had completely forgotten about it.
The retriever smiles. He can almost feel the heat of the lab’s crotch against his nose, smell the arousal
through the fabric, taste the pre on his tongue… The retriever realizes he’s at more than half mast, now.
Hastily, he grabs his lunch and dashes after the lab.
